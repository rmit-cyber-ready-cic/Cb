**Problem Statement:**
	How can regular maintenance updates or Facility Management asset statuses of Museum of London be accessible to the building managers and shift engineers so that they are updated when driving to work prior to a shift handover, allowing for better decision making.
 



**Solution:**
	An Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered voice assistant was built that integrates with a task management board such as Trello. An engineer's name would be read out along with the details of the assigned tasks to them. The intent was to read out the tasks of the day to the engineer on his way to work.




**Features:**

   - Personalization: Tasks read out along with engineers name
   - Voice commands to change task status 
   - States task deadlines in days/hours to help engineers manage and prioritise their tasks.


**Instructions:**

   - The code demonstrates handling intents from an Alexa skill using the Alexa Skills Kit SDK for Python.
   - Visit https://alexa.design/cookbook for additional examples on implementing slots, dialog management, session persistence, api calls, and more.
   - The code is built using the handler classes approach in skill builder.
